The business application models delivered with MSS Code Factory
2.13 are under a variety of licenses, including Apache V2,
Commercial/LGPLv3, Commercial/GPLv3, Commercial/Share, and
Commercial/Core licenses so copies of each of the five license
texts are included in the top level project directory, and in
the model directory, but you have to check the individual models
to know which license applies to that particular file.
